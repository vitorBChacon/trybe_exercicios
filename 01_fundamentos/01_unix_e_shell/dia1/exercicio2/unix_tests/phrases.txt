The best of both worlds
Speak of the devil
See eye to eye
Once in a blue moon
When pigs fly
To cost an arm and a leg
A piece of cake
Let the cat out of the bag
To feel under the weather
To kill two birds with one stone
To cut corners
To add insult to injury
You canâ€™t judge a book by its cover
Break a leg
To hit the nail on the head
A blessing in disguise
Call it a day
Let someone off the hook
No pain no gain
Bite the bullet
Getting a taste of your own medicine
Giving someone the cold shoulder
The last straw
The elephant in the room
Stealing someones thunder
